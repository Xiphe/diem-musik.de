## Lets make music together!

I was procrastinating for long enough, I want to create!

If you're a musician and/or content creator, know your tools and have an 
affinity for digital/internet stuff â€“ let's do something together!  
Lets either [**Start a Band**](#start-a-band) or [**collaborate**](#collaborate) on a song or video.

I don't want to hide in a rehearsal room or studio and come out with a finished
product every now and then. I want (mostly) each step to be visible! I want to
use the platforms out there to gain visibility and grow a community.

Currently I see two models but am completely open to other ideas.

<h3 id="start-a-band">Start a online Band</h3>

I'm a digital nomad, I live on a [campsite in Tarifa/Spain](https://goo.gl/maps/mu46M2uBjmJpDLuN6) and I don't want to
commit to a place. Thats why everything **must take place online**. We won't play
concerts (Which is currently hard anyways).  
We will create songs and content about the process.

If you want want to become part of the band you should:

 - Play an instrument, sing, produce, master, edit videos, make art, create content, 
   be a web-developer, do marketing or have some other ideas of how to contribute.
 - If you play an instrument or sing, be able to record yourself in great quality
 - Be comfortable creating "behind the scenes" content about what you're doing

Sounds cool? [Please get in contact with me, I don't bite ;)](#hit-me)

<h3 id="collaborate">Collaborate on single tracks</h3>

You don't want to commit on a bigger project or already have one? 
Let's do something together! I feel comfortable in a big variety of music styles
and would love to do something together with you!

If you have a track laying around that needs feedback or additional input
just [send it over](#hit-me) and I'll see what comes to mind.

Or [write me a message](#hit-me) and I'll send you some work in progress that you
could collaborate on!

As mentioned I'd love to not only create a finished product but also document
the steps. So you could also post a video and reach out publicly to me!
